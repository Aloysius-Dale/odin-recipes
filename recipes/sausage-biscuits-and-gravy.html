        <h2>How to Make Sausage Biscuits & Gravy</h2>
        <p>Often imitated, never duplicated. Just make sure that after you make these <a href="https://www.tasteandtellblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Biscuits-Sausage-Gravy-1.jpg">Sausage Biscuits & Gravy</a> for breakfast, you have a window of opportunity to go back to bed, because you won't be able to do much after consuming this. Cast-iron skillet is preferred. I prefer the taste that the maple sausage lends to the dish, however you could easily substitute regular or sage sausage in lieu of the maple.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (19oz) can Southern-Style flaky refrigerated biscuits</li>
            <li>1 (16oz) package maple-flavored breakfast sausage</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-ouroise flour, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (12oz) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Arrange biscuits roughly 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheet.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 13-17 minutes. Slice cooked biscuits in half crosswise and keep warm.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>While biscuits are baking, crumble sausage into a large skillet over medium heat; cook, breaking meat apart, until no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle sausage and pan drippings with flour and cook and stir until sausage is coated, about 1 more minute. Reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Pour evaporated milk into sausage mixture, followed by milk; stir until thoroughly combined. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, and cook until gravy is your desired thickness, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and ground black pepper. Stir butter into gravy until melted. Stir in more flour if gravy isn't thick enough.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Place biscuits with cut sides up on serving plates; top with sausage gravy.</li>
        </ol>
